# Śrī Kṛṣṇacandrāṣṭakam (Eight Verses in Praise of Lord Kṛṣṇacandra)

print('''I worship Kṛṣṇacandra, the beloved of Rādhikā,
Who is as magnificent as a great dark-blue cloud,
Who has a charming smile,
Who is praised by Śiva, Brahmā, and other deities,
Who is the abode of Lakṣmī (Ramā),
And who destroys the suffering of the gods.

I worship Kṛṣṇacandra, the beloved of Rādhikā,
Who is the essence of divine rasa,
Who is known through the Vedas and Vedānta but remains difficult to attain,
Yet is easily accessible to His devotees,
Who is the destroyer of demons,
Who wears swinging earrings,
And who is the shining light of the lunar dynasty.

I worship Kṛṣṇacandra, the beloved of Rādhikā,
Who is lovingly cherished by Yaśodā and others,
Who is the embodiment of supreme fulfillment,
Who enchants the eyes of all,
Who appears in His original, eternal form,
And who returns home in the evening,
Seeking the exclusive devotion of His devotees.

I worship Kṛṣṇacandra, the beloved of Rādhikā,
Who showers His merciful glances upon His grove,
Who dwells there with His most intimate associates,
Who grants them the vision of His divine pastimes,
And who performs His exclusive, transcendental līlās in their company.

I worship Kṛṣṇacandra, the beloved of Rādhikā,
Who, when caught stealing milk by the Gopīs in their homes,
Casts His innocent, enchanting glances upon them and swiftly flees,
Yet, in their separation from Him,
He bestows upon them the supreme wealth of divine love.

I worship Kṛṣṇacandra, the beloved of Rādhikā,
Whose broad chest is adorned with the shining Kaustubha jewel,
Whose feet are beautified by the resplendent Vaijayantī garland,
And whose forehead glows with sacred sandalwood paste and musk.

I worship Kṛṣṇacandra, the beloved of Rādhikā,
Who, while milking the cows, catches sight of Rādhā’s lotus face,
And in that very moment,
Becomes absorbed in the desire to meet Her,
His heart filled with exclusive, boundless love for Her.

Whoever recites this Kṛṣṇacandrāṣṭakam with love and devotion,
Attains the constant presence of Lord Kṛṣṇa.
In this age of Kali, such a devotee is freed from the great suffering of material existence,
And surely attains the fearless abode of Lord Viṣṇu.'''
